# The People's Republic of China's Cyber Power: May 2023 Analysis

## Introduction

According to a report published by Booz Allen Hamilton, Beijing’s chief motivations for carrying out cyberattacks or espionage are related to the nation’s political system, territory, and economy. The report identifies three “core interests” over which China is willing to authorize offensive cyber operations if threatened: Security, Sovereignty, and Development.

Security relates to the guarantee for China’s long-term social stability in its political and social system, organized and led by the CCP. Sovereignty relates to China’s exclusive authority and control in various land and maritime areas. Development relates to China’s ambitions of securing its economic activities.

## Tactics

According to a report published by Booz Allen Hamilton, China has developed a [“three warfare”](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3676075/china-s-attack-motivations-tactics-and-how-cisos-can-mitigate-threats.html) approach to shaping the information environment. These are Psychological, Media, and Legal warfare1. The report synthesized primary PRC attack tactics based on several recent case studies, outlining four methods most used in campaigns. These are DDoS, defacement of websites/digital signage, breaches of industrial control systems (ICS), and ransomware1.

On July 19, 2021, the U.S. government and its allies publicly condemned and blamed the PRC for a series of malicious cyberattacks, including the Microsoft Exchange Hacks, global ransomware attacks, and cyberattacks against [medical research institutes and universities](https://www.ironnet.com/blog/china-cyber-attacks-the-current-threat-landscape).

## Tools

PRC state-sponsored cyber actors frequently utilize open-source tools for reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning. The actors have utilized open-source router specific software frameworks, RouterSploit and RouterScan [ T1595.002 ], to identify makes, models, and known vulnerabilities for [further investigation and exploitation](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a).


## PRC's Targeting of Diaspora Communities

Overseas Chinese diaspora communities are both a primary target for PRC influence operations. In most cases, PRC threats to civil liberties fall disproportionately on diaspora communities and individuals, and the impact has often been severe. The impact falls overwhelmingly on the political rights of the Greater Chinese diaspora, especially [PRC political dissidents](https://uscnpm.org/2021/09/14/prc-overseas-influence-disaggregating-the-risks/), ethnic minorities, and those from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang.

According to a policy report released by the Royal United Services Institute in London, it is crucial to carefully disaggregate the different kinds of risks posed by the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) overseas political activities. Some clearly are matters of national security because they concern the basic integrity of the political system and its decision-making processes. Yet, many of the most pressing challenges instead concern encroachments on the civil liberties of vulnerable individuals and groups outside the mainland, particularly Chinese dissidents and persecuted ethnic groups.

## Protecting the Diaspora

Protecting and integrating diaspora communities into the greater "national fold" is important for defending against foreign attacks, including those from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and other agencies. Diaspora communities can help prepare local communities to accept new arrivals of migrants and assist newcomers. Community actors such as faith-based groups, community associations, and student societies play a critical welcoming and supporting role¹³.

By integrating diaspora communities into the larger society, host countries can help to ensure that these individuals have access to the same rights, protections, and opportunities as other members of society. This can help to reduce feelings of marginalization or exclusion, which can make individuals more vulnerable to foreign influence.

Furthermore, by integrating diaspora communities into the larger society, host countries can tap into the unique skills, knowledge, and perspectives that these individuals bring. This can help to enrich the cultural fabric of society and enhance the country's ability to compete in the global marketplace.

In summary, protecting and "pulling in" Chinese and other diaspora communities into the greater "national fold" is important for building trust and loyalty, ensuring equal rights and opportunities, and tapping into the unique contributions that these individuals can make.

## Recommendations

There are several measures that can be taken to integrate diaspora communities who may be skilled in cyber and other needed skills. These measures can include:

1. Providing targeted training and education programs: Governments and organizations can provide targeted training and education programs to help members of diaspora communities develop their skills in areas such as cybersecurity. This can help to increase their employability and integration into the workforce.

2. Offering mentorship and networking opportunities: Mentorship and networking opportunities can help members of diaspora communities connect with professionals in their field of expertise. This can help them to build relationships, gain valuable insights, and access job opportunities.

3. Promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace: Employers can promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace by actively recruiting members of diaspora communities and providing them with equal opportunities for career advancement. This can help to create a more inclusive work environment where individuals from diverse backgrounds feel valued and supported.

4. Supporting entrepreneurship: Governments and organizations can support entrepreneurship among members of diaspora communities by providing access to funding, mentorship, and other resources. This can help individuals to start their own businesses, create jobs, and contribute to the economy.

In summary, measures such as targeted training and education programs, mentorship and networking opportunities, promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and supporting entrepreneurship can help to integrate diaspora communities who may be skilled in cyber and other needed skills.
